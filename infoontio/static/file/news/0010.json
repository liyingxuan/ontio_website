      "content":"In October 2016, together with Chinese key enterprises, the CESI (China Electronics Standardization Institute) founded the CBD-Forum (China Blockchain Technology and Industrial Development Forum). While endeavoring in blockchain technology and application development, CBD-Forum initiated an open-source community, DAppLedger (Distributed Application Ledger). Based on the fundamental platform autonomously developed by community members, DAppLedger is building a multi-platform operation model, seeking the best structure during application integration. DAppLedger will draft a series of open blockchain standards, as to realize the modularization of the blockchain system, which is inter-operative and pluggable. In this way, DAppLedger can drive the development of blockchain core technologies and support blockchain startups and innovations."
